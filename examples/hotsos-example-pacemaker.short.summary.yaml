    https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1874719: 'A node with the hostname node1 is currently
      configured and enabled on pacemaker. This is caused by a known bug and you can
      remove the node by running the following command on the application-hacluster
      leader: juju run-action <application>-hacluster/leader delete-node-from-ring
      node=node1 --wait

      If the above action is not available in the charm, you can run the following
