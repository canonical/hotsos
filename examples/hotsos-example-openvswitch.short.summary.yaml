  openvswitch:
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1978806: This node is using OpenvSwitch and conntrack
      is tracking encapsulated packets (geneve, vxlan etc). This is considered unnecessary
      since it is duplicating tracking for the same packets done by ovs and at scale
      will have a performance impact. See referenced bug for solution and workaround.
