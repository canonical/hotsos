  openvswitch:
    - desc: This node is using OpenvSwitch and conntrack is tracking encapsulated
        packets (geneve, vxlan etc). This is considered unnecessary since it is duplicating
        tracking for the same packets done by ovs and at scale will have a performance
        impact. See referenced bug for solution and workaround.
