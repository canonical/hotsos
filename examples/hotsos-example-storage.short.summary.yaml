    - desc: Found OSDs osd.0, osd.1, osd.2 with metadata usage > 5% of its total device
        usage. This could be the result of a compaction failure. Possibly related
        to the bug https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/45903 if Ceph < 14.2.17. To manually
        compact the metadata, use 'ceph-bluestore-tool' which is available since 14.2.0.
