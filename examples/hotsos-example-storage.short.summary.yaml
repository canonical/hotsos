    - desc: This Ceph cluster is vulnerable to bug https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/53729
        in which OSD(s) can consume considerable amounts of memory and eventually
        be OOM killed due to potentially millions of duplicate entries for PG(s).
        If affected, it is very hard to recover the OSD(s) so the recommendation is
        to get the cluster upgraded to a version containing a fix if available. At
        the time of writing a partial fix is available for Octopus/15.2.17 (offline
        PG trimming via ceph-objectstore-tool) but Octopus, Pacific and Quincy are
        still pending release of the full fix. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ceph/+bug/1978913
        for full update on Ubuntu package fixes. Please disable PG autoscaler for
        all pools (set them to 'warn' mode) as PG splitting/merging can exacerbate
        the possibility of hitting this bug.
