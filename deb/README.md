# Daily Debian Builds

Daily debian builds are provided in https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-support-team/+archive/ubuntu/hotsos as an alternative to the builds in [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/hotsos)

This directory contains config used by the daily deb builder. The builder is configured in https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-support-team/+recipe/hotsos and does not support pyproject.toml so we have to provide these setuptools equivalent configs.
