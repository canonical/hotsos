        Provides a generic way to categorise events. The default is to group

        label, beneath which the events are grouped by date. If a time value is
        also available, events will be grouped by time beneath their date. It
        may sometimes be useful to group events by date at the top level which
        is also supported here.

        The date, time and key values are extracted from each event search
        result and  are expected to be at indexes 1, 2 and 3 respectively. If
        the search result only has two groups it is assumed that the second is

                            make sense to categorise by event type.

                             date to provide an extra level of granularity.

                                    match properly) the results for each date
