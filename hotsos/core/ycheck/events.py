        label, beneath which the events are grouped by date. If a time value is
        also available, events will be grouped by time beneath their date. It
        may sometimes be useful to group events by date at the top level which
        is also supported here.

        result and  are expected to be at indexes 1, 2 and 3 respectively. If
        the search result only has two groups it is assumed that the second is
