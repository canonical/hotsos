    A known mongodb bug has been identified that is known to affect juju
    controller backups (see https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/TOOLS-1636 for
    more context on the underlying issue). A workaround is to pass
    --no-logs to juju create-backup. This issue only affects Mongo 3 so
    using a higher version should avoid the issue.
