  JujuWarning: >-
    The juju snap is installed from the latest/stable channel which is
    discouraged since the release of the snap in that channel can/will change
    at random and will auto-upgrade which may be undesired. The
    recommended way is to use a specific release track/channel so that
    release (or major version) upgrades can be performed in a controlled
    way. See 'snap info juju' for available channels.
