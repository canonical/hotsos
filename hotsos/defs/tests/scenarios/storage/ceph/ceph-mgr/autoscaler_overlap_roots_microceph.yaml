  CephMgrError: >-
    PG autoscaler found overlapping roots for pool(s). As a
    result, PG autoscaler won't scale those pools. This happens
    when a pool uses a crush rule that doesn't distinguish
    between OSD device classes. Any pool using that crush rule
    would use OSDs from multiple device classes. Identify those
    pools (ceph osd crush tree --show-shadow) and change their
    crush rule to use only one of the device classes.
