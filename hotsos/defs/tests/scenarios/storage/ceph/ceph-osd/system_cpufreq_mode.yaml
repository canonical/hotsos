  CephWarning: >-
    This node has Ceph OSDs running on it but is not using
    cpufreq scaling_governor in "performance" mode
    (actual=powersave). This is not recommended and can result
    in performance degradation. To fix this you can install
    cpufrequtils, set "GOVERNOR=performance" in
    /etc/default/cpufrequtils and run systemctl restart
    cpufrequtils. You will also need to stop and disable the
    ondemand systemd service in order for changes to persist.
