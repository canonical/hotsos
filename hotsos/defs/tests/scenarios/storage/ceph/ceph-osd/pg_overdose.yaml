  CephOSDWarning: >-
    ceph is trying to create 813 PGs on osd.38 but the hard limit is 750.
    The mon_max_pg_per_osd or osd_max_pg_per_osd_hard_ratio may be
    increased as a workaround. Please see
    www.ceph.com/community/new-luminous-pg-overdose-protection
    Note if the pending PGs are more than double the hard limit,
    it needs further investigation before applying the workaround.
