    This host has Ceph OSDs using Quincy version < 17.2.6 and are
    vulnerable to LP bug 2013960 which has fix in 17.2.6 release.
    The workaround is to use 'wpq' scheduler with the steps:
    1. set osd_op_queue to 'wpq': `sudo ceph config set osd osd_op_queue wpq`
    2. Rolling restart of all the OSDs with `noout` and `norebalance` flags set
    3. Confirm that 'wpq' is now set: `ceph tell osd.* config get osd_op_queue`
