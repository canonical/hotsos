  https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/53729: >-
    This Ceph cluster is vulnerable to bug https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/53729 in
    which OSD(s) can consume considerable amounts of memory and eventually be OOM
    killed due to potentially millions of duplicate entries for PG(s). If affected,
    it is very hard to recover the OSD(s) so the recommendation is to get
    the cluster upgraded to a version containing a fix. The fixes are
    available in 15.2.17-0ubuntu0.20.04.4 for Octopus, 16.2.11 for Pacific, 17.2.5
    for Quincy.
    For some earlier versions of Octopus, it's possible to do offline trimming using
    ceph-objectstore-tool.
    Please disable PG autoscaler for all pools (set them to 'warn' mode) as PG
    splitting/merging can exacerbate the possibility of hitting this bug.
