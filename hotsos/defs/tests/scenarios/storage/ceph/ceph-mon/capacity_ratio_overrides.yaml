raised-issues:
  CephMonWarning: >-
    One or more Ceph capacity ratios are set higher than the usual defaults
    nearfull=0.90 (default: 0.85), backfillfull=0.95 (default: 0.90),
    full=0.95 (default: 0.95). These ratios control when Ceph
    warns and blocks operations as the cluster approaches capacity. Setting
    them higher than defaults can delay critical warnings and risk the cluster
    becoming toofull before warning. Please revert any of the increased
    values to their default values.
