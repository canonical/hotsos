    This Ceph cluster is vulnerable to a bug in which OSDs can consume
    considerable amounts of memory and eventually be OOM killed due to
    potentially millions of duplicate PG entries. If affected, it is very hard
    to recover the OSDs so the recommendation is to get the cluster upgraded to
    a version containing a fix. The fixes are available as of
    15.2.17-0ubuntu0.20.04.4 (Octopus), 16.2.11 (Pacific) and 17.2.5 (Quincy).
    For some earlier versions of Octopus it is possible to do offline trimming
    using ceph-objectstore-tool.
