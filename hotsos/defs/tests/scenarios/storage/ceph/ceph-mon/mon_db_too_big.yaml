  CephMonWarning: >-
    Ceph is reporting that for mon juju27, the leveldb database
    used to store cluster metadata is using a lot of disk space
    which may cause slow queries and delayed response to clients.
    Recommendation is to run compaction on the mon db. Please see
    docs.ceph.com/en/quincy/rados/operations/health-checks/#mon-disk-big
