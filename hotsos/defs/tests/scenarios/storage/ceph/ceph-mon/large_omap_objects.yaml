  CephWarning: >-
    Large omap objects found in pgs '2.f'. This is usually resolved by
    deep-scrubbing the pgs. Check config options
    'osd_deep_scrub_large_omap_object_key_threshold' and
    'osd_deep_scrub_large_omap_object_value_sum_threshold' to
    find whether the values of these keys are too high.
