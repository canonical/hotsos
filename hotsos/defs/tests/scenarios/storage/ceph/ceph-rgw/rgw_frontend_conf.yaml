  CephRGWWarning: >-
    Ceph RGW is using the 'civetweb' frontend. You are recommended to switch to 'beast'
    which provides better performance (civetweb has been removed from Ceph Pacific
    (16.2.0) onwards). Upgrading the ceph-radosgw charm (from stable/21.10 or newer) will
    switch to use the beast frontend.
