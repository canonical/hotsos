    LXDWarning: >-
      The lxd snap is installed from the latest/stable channel which is
      discouraged since the release of the snap in that channel can/will change
      at random and will auto-upgrade which may be undesired. The
      recommended way is to use a specific release track/channel so that
      release (or major version) upgrades can be performed in a controlled
      way. See 'snap info lxd' for available channels.
