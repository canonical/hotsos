  LXDWarning:
    - >-
      libfuse is out of pids. This can happen due to a known lxcfs
      deadlock detailed in https://github.com/lxc/lxcfs/issues/471.
      This is fixed in lxd snap version 5.10 (5.10-b392610)
    - >-
      This host has lxc containers and is using LXD version 5.9 which
      is known to be affected by a lxcfs deadlock bug that causes reads
      and writes to permanently block leading to a large backlog of lxcfs
      threads and eventually a kernel crash because of hung tasks. The bug
      is fixed in LXD 5.10. For more information see
      https://github.com/lxc/lxcfs/issues/471.
