raised-issues:
  OpenstackError: >-
    The privsep daemon used by the neutron-openvswitch-agent service on this host is
    reporting ValueError errors for max_str_len that suggest it has crashed due
    to the amount of data being transferred between the privileged and
    unprivileged threads exceeding the allowed limit. This is known to cause
    unresponsive agents.
raised-bugs:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/2029952: >-
    This host is running neutron agents that use python3-oslo.privsep and the
    installed version (2.1.1-0ubuntu1) is impacted by a known bug that can
    cause the agents to become unresponsive in loaded environments. See bug for
    full details. You are recommended to upgrade this package and restart
    neutron agents.
