    Known Keystone bug identified that causes Denial-of-Service when
    LDAP connection pooling is enabled via use_pool=True. This bug may
    manifest itself in LDAP operations such as OpenStack dashboard login
    failures. It is recommended to upgrade to the next point release
    available for the package. To workaround LDAP login failure problem,
    disable LDAP pooling by setting `ldap-use-pool` to `false` for *all*
    deployed `keystone-ldap` applications in charmed deployments. For
    non-charmed deployments, set `use_pool` to `false` in the LDAP domain
    /etc/keystone/domains/*.conf file.
