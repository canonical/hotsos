    Known nova compute issue caused when package gir1.2-libosinfo-1.0 is installed
    and apparmor is set to enforce. To fix the issue, the offending package needs to
    be removed, or apparmor set to complain, or the rules would need to be added to the
    apparmor profile (but this is not supported and can be overridden). Please refer
    to the Launchpad #2012284 bug page more information.
