  OpenstackWarning:
    The version of Openstack Nova (3:25.1.1-0ubuntu1.1~cloud0) running on this
    host contains a fix for CVE-2023-2088 but does not have service tokens
    enabled which is a hard requirement for the fix to work and means that some
    operations such volume attach/detach will not work. If this environment
    uses Openstack Charms you need to upgrade your charm to get this fixed.
    Please read https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/cve-2023-2088-for-charmed-openstack/37051 for more information.
