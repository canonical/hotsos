  OpenstackWarning: >-
    The nova-cloud-controller charm on this host has failed to populate the ssh
    known_hosts for one or more nova-compute unit. A common cause is when this
    unit cannot reach the remote compute host on the network for which it is
    trying to add the host/address. Please check that this host is able to
    reach host 10.11.12.2.
