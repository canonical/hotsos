    Known RabbitMQ issue where queues get stuck and clients
    trying to use them will just keep timing out. This stops
    many services in the cloud from working correctly.
    Resolution requires you to stop all RabbitMQ servers
    before starting them all again at the same time. A
    rolling restart or restarting them simultaneously will
    not work. See bug for more detail.
