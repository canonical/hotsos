  MemoryWarning: >-
    This host is using hugepages which are consuming 320GB out of 377GB total system
    memory i.e. 85%. This leaves 2GB available memory for processes not using
    hugepages. Also, only 4% of the hugepages are being actively used. Memory
    reserved for hugepages can't be used for any other purpose which may starve the system of
    available memory. Please review /proc/meminfo and your current hugepages configuration to see
    if you can reduce the hugepages allocation. For details, see the kernel documentation at
    https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.html.
