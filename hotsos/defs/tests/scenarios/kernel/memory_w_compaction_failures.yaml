      The following numa nodes have limited high order memory
      available: node0-normal. At present the top 5 highest
      consumers of memory are: buffer_head (87540.6796875k),
      anon_vma_chain (9068.0k), radix_tree_node (50253.65625k),
      Acpi-State (5175.703125k), vmap_area (2700.0k). See `memory:nodes`
      section in kernel summary or /proc/buddyinfo for more info.

      Memory compaction (defragmentation) success to failure ratio is at 11%.
      This suggests that the system's memory is getting fragmented but the
      defragmentation attempts are failing at a significant rate, which can
      indicate that there are insufficient high-order memory blocks available
      and the kernel cannot form larger blocks on request. Running on a highly
      fragmented memory will have a negative impact on the system's performance,
      especially for memory I/O intensive workloads. See /proc/vmstat for more
      info.
