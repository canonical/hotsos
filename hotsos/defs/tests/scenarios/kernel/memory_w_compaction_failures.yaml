      The following numa nodes have limited high order memory
      available: node0-normal. At present the top 5 highest
      consumers of memory are: buffer_head (87540.6796875k),
      anon_vma_chain (9068.0k), radix_tree_node (50253.65625k),
      Acpi-State (5175.703125k), vmap_area (2700.0k). See
      summary or /proc/buddyinfo for more info.
    - >-
      Memory compaction failures are at 11% of successes. This can
      suggest that there are insufficient high-order memory blocks
      available and the kernel is unable form larger blocks on
      request which can slow things down. See vmstat output for
      more detail.
