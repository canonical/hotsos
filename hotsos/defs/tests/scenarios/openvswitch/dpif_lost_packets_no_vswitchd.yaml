  OpenvSwitchWarning: >-
    This host is running Openvswitch and its datapath is
    reporting a non-zero amount (54691089) of "lost" packets
    which implies that packets are being dropped by the
    kernel before they reach userspace (e.g. vm tap).
    Causes for this can include high system load, tc rules in
    the datapath etc. Suggested actions are (a) check ovs-appctl
    dpctl/show to see if the number of lost packets is increasing
    and (b) check the ovs-vswitchd logs for more context and
    check the path between nic and ovs.
