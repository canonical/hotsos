  OVNError: >-
    The ovn-controller service on this node is reporting northd version
    mismatch errors. This happens when the version of OVN differs between
    ovn-central and ovn-controller and you have ovn-match-northd-version=false
    set locally. This flag is intended to protect against downtime during major
    release upgrades by preventing the ovn-controller from getting updates from
    the southbound database until the versions match. The version difference is
    reported as 22.03.2-20.21.0-61.4 vs. 22.03.0-20.21.0-58.3 and the local
    version of ovn-controller (22.03.2-0ubuntu0.22.04.1~cloud1). If this is a
    major release upgrade you will need to set the following locally prior to
    upgrade to prevent ovn-controller downtime during the upgrade: 'ovs-vsctl
    set Open_vSwitch . external-ids:ovn-match-northd-version="true"'
