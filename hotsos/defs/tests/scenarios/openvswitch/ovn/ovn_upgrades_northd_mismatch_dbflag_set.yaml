  OVNError: >-
    The ovn-controller service on this node is reporting northd version
    mismatch errors. This happens when the version of OVN differs between
    ovn-central and ovn-controller and you have ovn-match-northd-version=true
    set locally. This flag is intended to protect against downtime during major
    release upgrades by preventing the ovn-controller from getting updates from
    the southbound database until the versions match. It is not necessary for
    this flag to be set to 'true' during minor release upgrades. The version
    difference is reported as 22.03.2-1.2.3 vs. 22.03.1-1.2.3. If you are
    performing a major version upgrade this problem should disappear once the
    upgrade has completed on both ovn-central and locally. If you are
    performing a minor release upgrade you can safely do 'ovs-vsctl set
    Open_vSwitch . external-ids:ovn-match-northd-version="false"' and that
    should allow ovn-controller to resume service.
