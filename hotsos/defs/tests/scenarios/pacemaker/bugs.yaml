    A node with the hostname node1 is currently configured and enabled on
    pacemaker. This is caused by a known bug and you can remove the node by
    running the following command on the application-hacluster leader:
    juju run-action <application>-hacluster/leader delete-node-from-ring node=node1 --wait

    If the above action is not available in the charm, you can run the
    following command:
    juju run --application <application>-hacluster -- sudo crm_node -R node1 --force
