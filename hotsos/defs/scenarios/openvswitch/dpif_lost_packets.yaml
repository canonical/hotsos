vars:
  num_lost_packets: '@hotsos.core.plugins.openvswitch.OVSDPLookups.lost'
  lost_packets_msg_part1: >-
    This host is running Openvswitch and its datapath is reporting a non-zero
    amount
  lost_packets_msg_part2: >-
    of "lost" packets which implies that packets are being dropped by the kernel
    before they reach userspace (e.g. vm tap).
  lost_packets_msg_vswitchd: >-
    vswitchd has also recently reported large numbers of dropped packets within
    a 24h period - logs like "system@ovs-system: lost packet on port channel".
  lost_packets_msg_cause_unknown: >-
    Causes for this can include high system load, tc rules in the datapath etc.
    Suggested actions are (a) check ovs-appctl dpctl/show to see if the number of
    lost packets is increasing and (b) check the ovs-vswitchd logs for more context
    and check the path between nic and ovs.
checks:

    varops: [[$num_lost_packets], [gt, 5]]  # allow a very small number
