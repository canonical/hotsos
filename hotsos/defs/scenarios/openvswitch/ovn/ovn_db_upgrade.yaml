        This usually means ovn-central (ovn-northd etc) services have been upgraded before
        ovn-controller using a version of ovn that does not support this. To fix this issue
        you need to upgrade ovn-controller on this host (current={controller-ver}). See
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/charm-ovn-chassis/+bug/1940043 for more details.

        although the installed version ({controller-ver}) of ovn-controller
        should already have that fix.
