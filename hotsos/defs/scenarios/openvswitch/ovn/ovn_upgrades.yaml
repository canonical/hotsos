        unnecessary ovn-controller service interruption if a minor release

        major release upgrades by preventing the ovn-controller from getting
        updates from the southbound database until the versions match. It is
        not necessary for this flag to be set to 'true' during minor release
        upgrades. The version difference is reported as {vlocal} vs. {vremote}.
        If you are performing a major version upgrade this problem should
        disappear once the upgrade has completed on both ovn-central and
        locally. If you are performing a minor release upgrade you can safely
        do 'ovs-vsctl set Open_vSwitch . external-ids:{dbkey}="false"' and that
        should allow ovn-controller to resume service.
