        unnecessary ovn-controller service interruption if a minor release

        not necessary for this flag to be set to 'true' during minor release
        upgrades. The version difference is reported as {vlocal} vs. {vremote}.
        If you are performing a major version upgrade this problem should
        disappear once the upgrade has completed on both ovn-central and
        locally. If you are performing a minor release upgrade you can safely
        do 'ovs-vsctl set Open_vSwitch . external-ids:{dbkey}="false"' and that
        should allow ovn-controller to resume service.
