      message: >-
        OpenvSwitch (vswitchd) is reporting flows hitting action resubmit
        limit ({value}) which suggests that packets are being silently
        dropped. One cause of this is when you have too many flows and an
        example is when you have an excess of ovn logical flows. Look for
        "resubmit actions on bridge" in /var/log/openvswitch/ovs-vswitchd.log
        for more info and see what type of flow is resulting in this limit
        being hit.
