      message: >-
        A known mongodb bug has been identified that is known to affect juju
        controller backups (see https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/TOOLS-1636 for
        more context on the underlying issue). A workaround is to pass
        --no-logs to juju create-backup. This issue only affects Mongo 3 so
        using a higher version should avoid the issue.
