      message: >-
        A known ceph-osd charm bug has been identified - charm tried to zap a disk but
        failed since the disk has an LVM header. If you are sure the disk is
        not in active use by LVM, you may run pvremove on it before using it as
        an OSD - see LP bug for details.
