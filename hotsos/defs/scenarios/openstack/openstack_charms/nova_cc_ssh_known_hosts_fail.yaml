        The nova-cloud-controller charm on this host has failed to populate the
        ssh known_hosts for one or more nova-compute unit. A common cause is
        when this unit cannot reach the remote compute host on the network for
        which it is trying to add the host/address. Please check
        that this host is able to reach host {remote}.
