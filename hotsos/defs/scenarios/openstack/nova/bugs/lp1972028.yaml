      message: >-
        This host is affected by a bug in OpenStack Nova where polling libvirt
        for pci passthrough devices (usually during a vm migration) can
        trigger a race condition and cause an error to be raised. This is
        fixed in the latest packages on Ubuntu Jammy and above so upgrading is
        recommended (current={version}).
