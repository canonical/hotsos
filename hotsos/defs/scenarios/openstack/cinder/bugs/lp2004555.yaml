        impacted by security vulnerability CVE-2023-2088. There is a fix
        available in the Ubuntu archives and upgrading is recommended BUT it is
        essential to first upgrade your Openstack Charms so that you have
        support for enabling service tokens as it is hard requirement of the
        cve fix. Please read

        is a hard requirement for the fix to work and means that some
