        The version of Openstack Cinder ({pkg}={version}) running on this host is
        impacted by security vulnerability CVE-2023-2088. There is a fix
        available in the Ubuntu archives and upgrading is recommended BUT it is
        essential to first upgrade your Openstack Charms so that you have
        support for enabling service tokens as it is hard requirement of the
        cve fix. Please read

        a fix for CVE-2023-2088 but does not have service tokens enabled which
        is a hard requirement for the fix to work and means that some
