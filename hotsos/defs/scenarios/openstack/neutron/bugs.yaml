        This host may be affected by a bug in Openstack Neutron ML2 whereby
        if the neutron-openvswitch-agent service is not restarted after a
        restart of openvswitch-switch this can lead to inconsistent l2pop
        flows. If you think this node is impacted you can fix this with a
        restart of neutron-openvswitch-agent.

        The neutron-l3-agent service on this node appears to be impacted by the mentioned bug whereby
        it is consumed by the task of continuously respawning haproxy for a router that has
        been deleted. To workaround this problem you can manually create the missing
        namespace to allow the operation to complete. See bug report for details.

        neutron-server is reporting that ovsdb-client is not installed so is
        unable to perform some tasks. This is because package 'openvswitch-common'
        is missing. To workaround the problem you can manually install this
        package.
