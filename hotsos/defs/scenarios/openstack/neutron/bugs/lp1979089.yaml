      message: >-
        The neutron-l3-agent service on this node appears to be impacted by the mentioned bug whereby
        it is consumed by the task of continuously respawning haproxy for a router that has
        been deleted. To workaround this problem you can manually create the missing
        namespace to allow the operation to complete. See bug report for details.
