      message: >-
        This host may be affected by a bug in Openstack Neutron ML2 whereby
        if the neutron-openvswitch-agent service is not restarted after a
        restart of openvswitch-switch this can lead to inconsistent l2pop
        flows. If you think this node is impacted you can fix this with a
        restart of neutron-openvswitch-agent.
