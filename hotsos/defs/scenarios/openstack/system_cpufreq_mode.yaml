    This is not recommended and can result in performance degradation. To fix
    this you can install cpufrequtils, set "GOVERNOR=performance" in
    /etc/default/cpufrequtils and run systemctl restart cpufrequtils.
  msg_ondemand: >-
    You will also need to stop and disable the ondemand systemd service in
    order for changes to persist.
