      message: >-
        The {package} snap is installed from the {channel} channel which is
        discouraged since the release of the snap in that channel can/will
        change at random and will auto-upgrade which may be undesired. The
        recommended way is to use a specific release track/channel so that
        release (or major version) upgrades can be performed in a controlled
        way. See 'snap info {package}' for available channels.
