        This host has lxc containers and is using LXD version 5.9 which is
        known to be affected by a lxcfs deadlock bug that causes reads and
        writes to permanently block leading to a large backlog of lxcfs
        threads and eventually a kernel crash because of hung tasks. The bug
        is fixed in LXD 5.10. For more information see
        https://github.com/lxc/lxcfs/issues/471.

        libfuse is out of pids. This can happen due to a known lxcfs
        deadlock detailed in https://github.com/lxc/lxcfs/issues/471.
        This is fixed in lxd snap version 5.10 (5.10-b392610)
