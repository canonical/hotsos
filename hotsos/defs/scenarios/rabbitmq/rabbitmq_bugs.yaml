      message: >-
        Known RabbitMQ issue where queues get stuck and clients trying to use
        them will just keep timing out. This stops many services in the cloud
        from working correctly. Resolution requires you to stop all RabbitMQ
        servers before starting them all again at the same time. A rolling
        restart or restarting them simultaneously will not work. See bug for
        more detail.
