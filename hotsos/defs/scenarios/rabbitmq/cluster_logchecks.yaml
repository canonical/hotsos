      message: >-
        Transient mirrored classic queues are not deleted when there are no
        replicas available for promotion. Please stop all rabbitmq-server
        units and restart the cluster. Note that a rolling restart will not
        work.

    raises:
      type: RabbitMQWarning
      message: >-
        Messages were discarded because transient mirrored classic queues are
        not syncronized. Please stop all rabbitmq-server units and restart the
        cluster. Note that a rolling restart will not work.
