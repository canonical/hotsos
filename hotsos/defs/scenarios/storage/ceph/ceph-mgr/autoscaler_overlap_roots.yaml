      message: >-
        PG autoscaler found overlapping roots for pool(s). As a result, PG
        autoscaler won't scale those pools. This happens when a pool uses
        a crush rule that doesn't distinguish between OSD device classes.
        Any pool using that crush rule would use OSDs from multiple device
        classes. Identify those pools (ceph osd crush tree --show-shadow)
        and change their crush rule to use only one of the device classes.
