      message: >-
        One or more OSDs are using 'leveldb' backend. 'rocksdb' has been
        the default backend since Luminous release for performance reasons and
        'leveldb' support has been removed since Quincy release. Recommendation
        is to convert the Ceph OSDs to use 'rocksdb' backend.
