        This host has Ceph OSDs using Quincy version < 17.2.6 and are
        vulnerable to LP bug 2013960 which has fix in 17.2.6 release.
        The workaround is to use 'wpq' scheduler with the steps:
        1. set osd_op_queue to 'wpq': `sudo ceph config set osd osd_op_queue wpq`
        2. Rolling restart of all the OSDs with `noout` and `norebalance` flags set
        3. Confirm that 'wpq' is now set: `ceph tell osd.* config get osd_op_queue`
