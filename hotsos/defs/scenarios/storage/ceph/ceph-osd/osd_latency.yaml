      message: >-
        Latency for some I/O operations have been observed to be very high (> 5s).
        Please search for 'slow operation observed' in the OSD logs to see the
        OSDs that experienced them. This could be because the disk was overloaded
        temporarily which is fine (but might correlate with any performance drops).
        If this occurs consistently then it could be due to broken OSD/disk or
        high system load.
