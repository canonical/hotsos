        ceph is trying to create {} PGs on {} but the hard limit is {}.
        The mon_max_pg_per_osd or osd_max_pg_per_osd_hard_ratio may be
        increased as a workaround. Please see
        www.ceph.com/community/new-luminous-pg-overdose-protection
        Note if the pending PGs are more than double the hard limit,
        it needs further investigation before applying the workaround.
