    This Ceph cluster is vulnerable to a bug in which OSDs can consume
    considerable amounts of memory and eventually be OOM killed due to
    potentially millions of duplicate PG entries. If affected,
    it is very hard to recover the OSDs so the recommendation is to get
    the cluster upgraded to a version containing a fix. The fixes are
    available as of 15.2.17-0ubuntu0.20.04.4 (Octopus), 16.2.11 (Pacific) and
    17.2.5 (Quincy). For some earlier versions of Octopus it is possible to do
    offline trimming using ceph-objectstore-tool.
