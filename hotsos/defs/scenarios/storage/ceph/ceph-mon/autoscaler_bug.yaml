    This Ceph cluster is vulnerable to bug https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/53729 in
    which OSD(s) can consume considerable amounts of memory and eventually be OOM
    killed due to potentially millions of duplicate entries for PG(s). If affected,
    it is very hard to recover the OSD(s) so the recommendation is to get
    the cluster upgraded to a version containing a fix if available. At the time of
    writing a partial fix is available for Octopus/15.2.17 (offline PG trimming via
    ceph-objectstore-tool) but Octopus, Pacific and Quincy are still pending release
    of the full fix. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ceph/+bug/1978913
    for full update on Ubuntu package fixes.

        can exacerbate the possibility of hitting this bug.
