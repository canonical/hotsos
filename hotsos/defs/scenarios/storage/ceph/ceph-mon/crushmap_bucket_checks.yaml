        Found one or more unbalanced buckets in the cluster's CRUSH map.
        This can cause uneven data distribution or PG mapping issues in the cluster.
        Verify that "ceph osd crush tree --show-shadow" conforms to the expected layout for the cluster.
        Transient issues such as "out" OSDs, or cluster expansion/maintenance can trigger this warning.
        Affected CRUSH tree(s) and bucket types are {affected}.
