    raises:
      type: CephOSDError
      message: >-
        Cluster is experiencing slow ops.
        Causes include network issues (could do connectivity checks via ping,
        netstat/ip for packet drops), disk problems (check smartctl, sar,
        dmesg for errors), or OSDs are too busy/hung. Also check if PGs are
        in good state and can serve I/O (e.g. no inactive PGs).
        Ensure 'ceph osd require-osd-release <release>' is set correctly.
