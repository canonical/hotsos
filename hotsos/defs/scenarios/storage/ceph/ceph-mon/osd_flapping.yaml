    raises:
      type: CephOSDError
      message: >-
        Cluster is experiencing OSD flapping.
        Causes include network issues (could do connectivity checks via ping,
        netstat/ip for packet drops), disk problems (check smartctl, sar,
        dmesg for errors), or OSDs are too busy/hung. Also check if PGs are
        in good state and can serve I/O (e.g. no inactive PGs).
        Check if scrubbing and/or recovery is taking long time. Check if the
        flapping OSDs belong to specific nodes.
        Check if there OSDs can send heartbeat messages to each other. ALL
        the OSDs in the same cluster MUST be able to send/receive heartbeats
        to each other even if they belong to different storage classes.
