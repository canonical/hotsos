    raises:
      type: CephTrackerBug
      bug-id: 55383
      message: >-
        The ceph.log file is empty, this is likely because the version of
        ceph-mon on this node does not re-open
        /var/log/ceph/{ceph.log,ceph.audit.log} after log rotation. This leaves
        ceph.log empty and the logs are written to a deleted file. This will prevent
        you from seeing the cluster log and hotsos checks for information from these
        logs will not trigger. This issue is fixed in 17.2.5. You can work around
        this issue temporarily by setting
        `ceph config set global mon_cluster_log_to_journald false` and running
        `killall -HUP ceph-mon`.
