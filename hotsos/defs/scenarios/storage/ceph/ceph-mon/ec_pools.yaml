      message: >-
        One or more erasure-coded pools are being used. If cluster is
        experiencing performance issues and/or applications using EC pools
        are latency-sensitive, it may be better served to use replicated
        pools instead. When using EC pools, the additional computational
        cost involved should be considered against the storage efficiency
        it provides.
