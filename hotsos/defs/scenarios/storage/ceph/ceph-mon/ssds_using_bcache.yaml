      message: >-
        Found the osd(s) {osds} using bcache and their underlying block
        device of these OSDS appear to be SSDs. It's nearly always the case
        that the benefit of using bcache for SSD OSDs is nil and can even
        adversely affect performance in some cases. So this is likely to be a
        misconfiguration and it's probably better to remove the bcache and use
        the OSDs directly instead. Please compare the IOPs of the SSD (OSDs)
        vs. the bcache device (SSD/NVMe) to ascertain.
