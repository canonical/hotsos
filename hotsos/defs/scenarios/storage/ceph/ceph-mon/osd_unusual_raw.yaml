      message: >-
        Found OSD(s) {bad_osds} with larger raw usage size than the combined
        data+meta+omap usage. While a certain discrepancy is to be expected due to
        Ceph's using space not accounted by data+meta+omap columns, these are more
        than {limit}% and potentially indicate a bug in Ceph. If these OSDs appear
        full or misbehave, please restart them and possibly file a bug in Ceph tracker.
