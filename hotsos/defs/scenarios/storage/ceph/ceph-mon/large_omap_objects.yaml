      message: >-
        Large OMAP objects found in pgs '{large_omap_pgs}'.
        This is usually resolved by deep-scrubbing the pgs. Check config
        options 'osd_deep_scrub_large_omap_object_key_threshold' and
        'osd_deep_scrub_large_omap_object_value_sum_threshold' to find whether
        the values of these keys are too high. See

        for more info.
        If the large OMAP objects are reported from a pool used by OpenStack Gnocchi,
        it may need tuning: https://portal.support.canonical.com/ua/s/article/Gnocchi-causing-large-OMAP-objects-in-a-Ceph-cluster
