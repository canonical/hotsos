        This is usually resolved by deep-scrubbing the pgs. Check config
        options 'osd_deep_scrub_large_omap_object_key_threshold' and
        'osd_deep_scrub_large_omap_object_value_sum_threshold' to find whether
        the values of these keys are too high. See full summary for more detail.
