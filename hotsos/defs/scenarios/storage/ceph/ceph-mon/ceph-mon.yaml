# This requirement is used to define whether or not checks contained within this
# path are allowed to run. Both mon and osd nodes will have a ceph-mon package
# and systemd service installed so their existance alone is not enough to
# determine what kind of node this is. Since a ceph cluster will typically have
# more than one mon we also do not necessarily want to skip checks that can run
# if *any* mon is running. To achieve this we make this requirement sufficiently
# permissive such that the local ceph-mon service need not necessarily be
# active - checks themselves can apply more restrictive pre-requisites
# if necessary.
requires:
  # ensures that a ceph-mon unit is enabled but does not assert that it is active
  or:
    systemd:
      ceph-mon: enabled
    pebble: ceph-mon
