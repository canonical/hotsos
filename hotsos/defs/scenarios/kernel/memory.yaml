        Memory compaction (defragmentation) success to failure ratio is at {pcent}%.
        This suggests that the system's memory is getting fragmented but the defragmentation
        attempts are failing at a significant rate, which can indicate that there are
        insufficient high-order memory blocks available and the kernel cannot form larger
        blocks on request. Running on a highly fragmented memory will have a negative impact on
        the system's performance, especially for memory I/O intensive workloads. See /proc/vmstat
        for more info.
