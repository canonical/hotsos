      message: >-
        A node with the hostname node1 is currently configured and enabled on
        pacemaker. This is caused by a known bug and you can remove the node by
        running the following command on the application-hacluster leader:
        juju run-action <application>-hacluster/leader
        delete-node-from-ring node=node1 --wait

        If the above action is not available in the charm, you can run the
        following command:
        juju run --application <application>-hacluster --
        sudo crm_node -R node1 --force
