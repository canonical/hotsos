    This node is used for Kubernetes but is not using cpufreq
    scaling_governor in "performance" mode
  message_pt2: >-
    This is not recommended and can result in performance degradation. To fix
    this you can install cpufrequtils, set "GOVERNOR=performance" in
    /etc/default/cpufrequtils and run systemctl restart cpufrequtils.
  message_ondemand: >-
    You will also need to stop and disable the ondemand systemd service in
    order for changes to persist.
