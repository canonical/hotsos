        known mongodb bug identified - https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/TOOLS-1636
        Workaround is to pass --no-logs to juju create-backup. This is an issue
        only with Mongo 3. Mongo 4 does not have this issue. Upstream is
        working on migrating to Mongo 4 in the Juju 3.0 release.
