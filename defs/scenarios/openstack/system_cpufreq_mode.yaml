      message: >-
        This node is used as an Openstack hypervisor but is not using cpufreq
        scaling_governor in "performance" mode (actual={governor}). This is not
        recommended and can result in performance degradation. To fix this you
        can install cpufrequtils and set "GOVERNOR=performance" in
        /etc/default/cpufrequtils.
        NOTE: requires node reboot to take effect.
