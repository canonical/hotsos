        (total={packets}) which implies that packets destined for userspace
        (e.g. vm tap) are being dropped. ovs-vswitchd is also reporting large
        numbers of dropped packets within a 24h period (look for
        "system@ovs-system: lost packet on port channel"). This could be
        caused by overloaded system cores blocking ovs threads from
        delivering packets in time. Please check ovs-appctl dpctl/show to see
        if the number of lost packets is still increasing.
