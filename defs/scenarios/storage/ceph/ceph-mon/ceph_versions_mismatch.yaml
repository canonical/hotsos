        Ceph daemon versions are not aligned across the cluster. This could be the result
        of an incomplete or failed cluster upgrade. All daemons, except the clients,
        should ideally be on the same version for ceph to function correctly.

      message: >-
        One or more Ceph mons has a version lower than other daemons e.g.
        ceph-osd running in the cluster. This can cause unexpected behaviour
        and should be resolved as soon as possible. Check full summary output
        for current versions.
