# Definitions used to identify events in log files. Events can be single or
# multi-line. The former requires a start match and the latter requires a start
# and end.
#
# Supported fields (for full details see common.checks.EventChecksBase):
#
# * start: dict with elements "expr" and "hint" where expr is a regex pattern
#          used to match a log entry that identifies an event start point and
#          hint is an optional quick pre-search to be run before the full expr.
#
# * end: optional patter to match the end of a multi-line event.
#
# * datasource: relative path to file/directory we want to search.
#
# * allow-all-logs: whether to allow datasource to be wildcarded. The default
#                   is True and should be set to False if searching full
#                   history will result in excessive load or execution time.
#
# REMINDER: to use a single quote ' in a yaml string you need to put a double (single)quote i.e. ''
