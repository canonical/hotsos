  message: >-
    Known RabbitMQ issue where queues get stuck and clients trying to use
    them will just keep timing out. This stops many services in the cloud
    from working correctly. Resolution requires you to stop all RabbitMQ
    servers before starting them all again at the same time. A rolling
    restart or restarting them simultaneously will not work. See bug for
    more detail.
