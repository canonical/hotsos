# Definitions used to identify known bugs.
#
# Structure of definition is:
#
#   PLUGIN_NAME:
#     GROUP_NAME:
#       BUG_ID:
#         FIELDS
#
# GROUP_NAME - this is required but has no actual meaning and is just way to
#              organise definitions.
#
# FIELDS (for full details see common.checks.BugChecksBase):
#
# Mandatory:
#
#   * expr: python.re regex pattern used to match line(s). this can be a single
#           pattern or a list of patterns.
#
#     TIP: to use a single quote ' inside a yaml string you need to replace it
#          with two single quotes.
#
#   * reason: info displayed in output describing the bug/issue.
#
#   * path: relative path to file/directory we want to search.
#
# Optional:
#
#   * allow-all-logs: whether to allow path to be wildcarded. The default
#                     is True and should be set to False if searching full
#                     history will result in excessive load or execution time.
#
#   * reason-format-result-groups: optional list of python.re match group ids
#     that are available when expr is matched and that we want to use as input
#     reason when it is a formatted string.
#
#   * hint: optional short pattern used as a pre-filter before trying expr.

        Known issue where RabbitMQ queues get stuck and clients trying to use
        them will just keep timing out. This stops many services in the cloud
        from working correctly. Resolution requires you to stop all RabbitMQ
        servers before starting them all again at the same time. A rolling
        restart or restarting them simultaneously will not work. See bug for
        more detail.
