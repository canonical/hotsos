    ovn-controller is reporting frequent reconnections to the ovn
    southbound database due to "stale data" and this may require
    taking action to resolve. One cause is if you have recently
    rebuilt your southbound database. See the linked bug for more
    information. One suggested workaround is to run
    'ovn-appctl -t ovn-controller sb-cluster-state-reset'.
