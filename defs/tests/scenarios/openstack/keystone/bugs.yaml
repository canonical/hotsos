    Installed package 'keystone' with version 2:17.0.0-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 has a known bug
    that causes memory leak over time and causes LDAP logins to fail. It
    is recommended to upgrade to the next point release available for the
    package. To workaround LDAP login failure problem, disable LDAP pooling
    by setting `ldap-use-pool` to `false` for all deployed `keystone-ldap`
    applications in charmed deployments. For non-charmed deployments, set
    `use_pool` to `false` in the LDAP domain /etc/keystone/domains/*.conf
    file.
