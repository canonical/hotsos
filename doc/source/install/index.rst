Installing Hotsos
=================

There are a number of supported ways to install hotsos.

Debian Package (daily build)
----------------------------

This is the recommended way to install and is updated daily.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-support-team/hotsos
    sudo apt install hotsos

Snap Package
------------

A new build is published to the `snap <https://snapcraft.io/hotsos>`_ edge
channel after each commit landed in the main development branch. Builds are
promoted to stable once tested.

Please note that the snap is now a
`strictly confined snap <https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-confinement>`_
and therefore only supports
`sosreport <https://github.com/sosreport/sos>`_ :ref:`data root`
since it will not have access outside of $HOME.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo snap install hotsos

PyPI
----

A new build is published to `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/hotsos/>`_
after each commit lands in the main development branch.

Note: pipx is recommended instead of pip as it is considered more secure
and installs in a virtual environment (venv). Requires Python >= 3.8

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install pipx
    pipx install hotsos
