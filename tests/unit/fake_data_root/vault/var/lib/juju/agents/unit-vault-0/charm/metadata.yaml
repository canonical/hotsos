  Vault secures, stores, and tightly controls access to
  tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other
  secrets in modern computing. Vault handles leasing, key
  revocation, key rolling, and auditing. Through a unified
  API, users can access an encrypted Key/Value store and
  network encryption-as-a-service, or generate AWS IAM/STS
  credentials, SQL/NoSQL databases, X.509 certificates,
  SSH credentials, and more.
