      The last option should be used in conjunction with the key configuration
      option.
  key:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Key ID to import to the apt keyring to support use with arbitrary source
      configuration from outside of Launchpad archives or PPA's.
      The accepted formats should be a GPG key in ASCII armor format, 
      including  -----SCRUBBED markers or a keyid.
  use-syslog:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If set to True, supporting services will log to syslog.
  harden:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Apply system hardening. Supports a space-delimited list of modules
      to run. Supported modules currently include os, ssh, apache and mysql.
  config-flags:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      User provided Ceph configuration. Supports a string representation of
      a python dictionary where each top-level key represents a section in
      the ceph.conf template. You may only use sections supported in the
      template.
      .
      WARNING: this is not the recommended way to configure the underlying
      services that this charm installs and is used at the user's own risk.
      This option is mainly provided as a stop-gap for users that either
      want to test the effect of modifying some config or who have found
      a critical bug in the way the charm has configured their services
      and need it fixed immediately. We ask that whenever this is used,
      that the user consider opening a bug on this charm at
      http://bugs.launchpad.net/charms providing an explanation of why the
      config was needed so that we may consider it for inclusion as a
      natively supported config in the charm.
  osd-devices:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The devices to format and set up as OSD volumes.
      .
      These devices are the range of devices that will be checked for and
      used across all service units, in addition to any volumes attached
      via the --storage flag during deployment.
      .
      For ceph < 14.2.0 (Nautilus) these can also be directories instead of
      devices. If the value does not start with "/dev" then it will be
      interpreted as a directory.
  bdev-enable-discard:
    type: string
    default: auto
    description: |
      Enables async discard on devices. This option will enable/disable both
      bdev-enable-discard and bdev-async-discard options in ceph configuration
      at the same time. The default value "auto" will try to autodetect and
      should work in most cases. If you need to force a behaviour you can
      set it to "enable" or "disable". Only applies for Ceph Mimic or later.
  osd-journal:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The device to use as a shared journal drive for all OSDs on a node. By
      default a journal partition will be created on each OSD volume device for
      use by that OSD. The default behaviour is also the fallback for the case
      where the specified journal device does not exist on a node.
      .
      Only supported with ceph >= 0.48.3.
  bluestore:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: |
      Enable BlueStore storage backend for OSD devices.
      .
      Only supported with ceph >= 12.2.0.
      .
      Setting to 'False' will use FileStore as the storage format.
  bluestore-wal:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Path to a BlueStore WAL block device or file. Should only be set if using
      a separate physical device that is faster than the DB device (such as an
      NVDIMM or faster SSD). Otherwise BlueStore automatically maintains the
      WAL inside of the DB device. This block device is used as an LVM PV and
      then space is allocated for each block device as needed based on the
      bluestore-block-wal-size setting.
  bluestore-db:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Path to a BlueStore WAL db block device or file. If you have a separate
      physical device faster than the block device this will store all of the
      filesystem metadata (RocksDB) there and also integrates the Write Ahead
      Log (WAL) unless a further separate bluestore-wal device is configured
      which is not needed unless it is faster again than the bluestore-db
      device. This block device is used as an LVM PV and then space is
      allocated for each block device as needed based on the
      bluestore-block-db-size setting.
  osd-journal-size:
    type: int
    default: 1024
    description: |
      Ceph OSD journal size. The journal size should be at least twice the
      product of the expected drive speed multiplied by filestore max sync
      interval. However, the most common practice is to partition the journal
      drive (often an SSD), and mount it such that Ceph uses the entire
      partition for the journal.
      .
      Only supported with ceph >= 0.48.3.
  bluestore-block-wal-size:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Size (in bytes) of a partition, file or LV to use for
      BlueStore WAL (RocksDB WAL), provided on a per backend device basis.
      .
      Example: 128 GB device, 8 data devices provided in "osd-devices"
      gives 128 / 8 GB = 16 GB = 16000000000 bytes per device.
      .
      A default value is not set as it is calculated by ceph-disk (before Luminous)
      or the charm itself, when ceph-volume is used (Luminous and above).
  bluestore-block-db-size:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Size (in bytes) of a partition, file or LV to use for BlueStore
      metadata or RocksDB SSTs, provided on a per backend device basis.
      .
      Example: 128 GB device, 8 data devices provided in "osd-devices"
      gives 128 / 8 GB = 16 GB = 16000000000 bytes per device.
      .
      A default value is not set as it is calculated by ceph-disk (before Luminous)
      or the charm itself, when ceph-volume is used (Luminous and above).
  osd-format:
    type: string
    default: xfs
    description: |
      Format of filesystem to use for OSD devices. Supported formats include:
      .
        xfs (Default with >= ceph 0.48.3)
        ext4 (Only option < ceph 0.48.3)
        btrfs (experimental and not recommended)
      .
      Only supported with >= ceph 0.48.3.
      .
      Used with FileStore storage backend.
      .
      Always applies prior to ceph 12.2.0. Otherwise, only applies when the
      "bluestore" option is False.
  osd-encrypt:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      By default, the charm will not encrypt Ceph OSD devices; however, by
      setting osd-encrypt to True, Ceph's dmcrypt support will be used to
      encrypt OSD devices.
      .
      Specifying this option on a running Ceph OSD node will have no effect
      until new disks are added, at which point new disks will be encrypted.
  osd-encrypt-keymanager:
    type: string
    default: ceph
    description: |
      Keymanager to use for storage of dm-crypt keys used for OSD devices;
      by default 'ceph' itself will be used for storage of keys, making use
      of the key/value storage provided by the ceph-mon cluster.
      .
      Alternatively 'vault' may be used for storage of dm-crypt keys.  Both
      approaches ensure that keys are never written to the local filesystem.
      This also requires a relation to the vault charm.
  crush-initial-weight:
    type: float
    default:
    description: |
      The initial crush weight for newly added osds into crushmap.  Use this
      option only if you wish to set the weight for newly added OSDs in order
      to gradually increase the weight over time.  Be very aware that setting
      this overrides the default setting, which can lead to imbalance in the
      cluster, especially if there are OSDs of different sizes in use.  By
      default, the initial crush weight for the newly added osd is set to its
      volume size in TB.  Leave this option unset to use the default provided
      by Ceph itself. This option only affects NEW OSDs, not existing ones.
  osd-max-backfills:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      The maximum number of backfills allowed to or from a single OSD.
      .
      Setting this option on a running Ceph OSD node will not affect running
      OSD devices, but will add the setting to ceph.conf for the next restart.
  osd-recovery-max-active:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      The number of active recovery requests per OSD at one time. More requests
      will accelerate recovery, but the requests places an increased load on the
      cluster.
      .
      Setting this option on a running Ceph OSD node will not affect running
      OSD devices, but will add the setting to ceph.conf for the next restart.
  ignore-device-errors:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      By default, the charm will raise errors if a whitelisted device is found,
      but for some reason the charm is unable to initialize the device for use
      by Ceph.
      .
      Setting this option to 'True' will result in the charm classifying such
      problems as warnings only and will not result in a hook error.
  ephemeral-unmount:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Cloud instances provide ephemeral storage which is normally mounted
      on /mnt.
      .
      Setting this option to the path of the ephemeral mountpoint will force
      an unmount of the corresponding device so that it can be used as a OSD
      storage device. This is useful for testing purposes (cloud deployment
      is not a typical use case).
  ceph-public-network:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the public (front-side) network (e.g.,
      192.168.0.0/24)
      .
      If multiple networks are to be used, a space-delimited list of a.b.c.d/x
      can be provided.
  ceph-cluster-network:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the cluster (back-side) network (e.g.,
      192.168.0.0/24)
      .
      If multiple networks are to be used, a space-delimited list of a.b.c.d/x
      can be provided.
  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  sysctl:
    type: string
    default: '{ kernel.pid_max : 2097152, vm.max_map_count : 524288,
                kernel.threads-max: 2097152 }'
    description: |
      YAML-formatted associative array of sysctl key/value pairs to be set
      persistently. By default we set pid_max, max_map_count and
      threads-max to a high value to avoid problems with large numbers (>20)
      of OSDs recovering. very large clusters should set those values even
      higher (e.g. max for kernel.pid_max is 4194303).
  customize-failure-domain:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      Setting this to true will tell Ceph to replicate across Juju's
      Availability Zone instead of specifically by host.
  availability_zone:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Custom availability zone to provide to Ceph for the OSD placement
  max-sectors-kb:
    type: int
    default: 1048576
    description: |
      This parameter will adjust every block device in your server to allow
      greater IO operation sizes. If you have a RAID card with cache on it
      consider tuning this much higher than the 1MB default. 1MB is a safe
      default for spinning HDDs that don't have much cache.
  nagios_context:
    type: string
    default: "juju"
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the hostname
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
      .
          juju-myservice-0
      .
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      A comma-separated list of nagios servicegroups.
      If left empty, the nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup
  use-direct-io:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: Configure use of direct IO for OSD journals.
  autotune:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Enabling this option will attempt to tune your network card sysctls and
      hard drive settings. This changes hard drive read ahead settings and
      max_sectors_kb. For the network card this will detect the link speed
      and make appropriate sysctl changes.
      WARNING: This option is DEPRECATED and will be removed in the next release.
      Exercise caution when enabling this feature; examine and
      confirm sysctl values are appropriate for your environment. See
      http://pad.lv/1798794 for a full discussion.
  aa-profile-mode:
    type: string
    default: 'disable'
    description: |
      Enable apparmor profile. Valid settings: 'complain', 'enforce' or
      'disable'.
      .
      NOTE: changing the value of this option is disruptive to a running Ceph
      cluster as all ceph-osd processes must be restarted as part of changing
      the apparmor profile enforcement mode.  Always test in pre-production
      before enabling AppArmor on a live cluster.
  bluestore-compression-algorithm:
    type: string
    default: lz4
    description: |
      The default compressor to use (if any) if the per-pool property
      compression_algorithm is not set.
      .
      NOTE: The recommended approach is to adjust this configuration option on
      the charm responsible for creating the specific pool you are interested
      in tuning. Changing the configuration option on the ceph-osd charm will
      affect ALL pools on the OSDs managed by the named application of the
      ceph-osd charm in the Juju model.
  bluestore-compression-mode:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The default policy for using compression if the per-pool property
      compression_mode is not set. 'none' means never use compression.
      'passive' means use compression when clients hint that data is
      compressible. 'aggressive' means use compression unless clients hint that
      data is not compressible. 'force' means use compression under all
      circumstances even if the clients hint that the data is not compressible.
      .
      NOTE: The recommended approach is to adjust this configuration option on
      the charm responsible for creating the specific pool you are interested

      ceph-osd charm in the Juju model.
  bluestore-compression-required-ratio:
    type: float
    default:
    description: |
      The ratio of the size of the data chunk after compression relative to the
      original size must be at least this small in order to store the
      compressed version. The per-pool property `compression-required-ratio`
      overrides this setting.
      .
      NOTE: The recommended approach is to adjust this configuration option on
