  live-migration-permit-post-copy:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If live-migration is enabled, this option allows Nova to switch an
      on-going live migration to post-copy mode. The switch will happen if the
      migration reaches 'live-migration-completion-timeout'. This supersedes
      'live-migration-permit-auto-converge'.
  live-migration-permit-auto-converge:

    default:
    description: |
      Sets the pci_passthrough_whitelist option in nova.conf which allows PCI
      passthrough of specific devices to VMs.
      .
      Example applications: GPU processing, SR-IOV networking, etc.
      .
      NOTE: For PCI passthrough to work IOMMU must be enabled on the machine
      deployed to. This can be accomplished by setting kernel parameters on
      capable machines in MAAS, tagging them and using these tags as
      constraints in the model.
  pci-alias:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The pci-passthrough-whitelist option of nova-compute charm is used for
      specifying which PCI devices are allowed passthrough. pci-alias is more
      a convenience that can be used in conjunction with Nova flavor properties
      to automatically assign required PCI devices to new instances. You could,
      for example, have a GPU flavor or a SR-IOV flavor:
      .
        pci-alias='{"vendor_id":"8086","product_id":"10ca","name":"a1"}'
      .
      This configures a new PCI alias 'a1' which will request a PCI device with
      a vendor id of 0x8086 and a product id of 10ca. To input a list of
      aliases, use the following syntax in this charm config option:
      .
        pci-alias='[{...},{...}]'
      .
      For more information about the syntax of pci_alias, refer to
      https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/compute/config-options.html

      instance vCPUs can or cannot use. For example '^0,^2' to reserve two
      cpus for the host.
      .
      Starting from the Train release this option is deprecated and
      has been superseded by the 'cpu-shared-set' and
      'cpu-dedicated-set' options.  This option will be silently
      ignored if the 'cpu-dedicated-set' option is non-empty.
  cpu-shared-set:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Sets compute/cpu_shared_set option in nova.conf and defines which

  cpu-dedicated-set:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Sets compute/cpu_dedicated_set option in nova.conf and defines which
      physical CPUs will be used for dedicated guest vCPU resources.
      .
      This option is only available from the Train release and later.
      If non-empty it will silently stop the 'vcpu-pin-set' option
      from being used.
  virtio-net-tx-queue-size:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      Sets libvirt/tx_queue_size option in nova.conf. Larger queues sizes for
      virtio-net devices increases networking performance by amortizing vCPU
      preemption and avoiding packet drops. Only works with Rocky and later,
      since QEMU 2.10.0 and libvirt 3.7.0. Default value 256. Authorized
      values [256, 512, 1024].
  virtio-net-rx-queue-size:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      Sets libvirt/rx_queue_size option in nova.conf. Larger queues sizes for
      virtio-net devices increases networking performance by amortizing vCPU
      preemption and avoiding packet drops. Only works with Rocky and later,

  use-internal-endpoints:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      OpenStack mostly defaults to using public endpoints for
      internal communication between services. If set to True this option will
      configure services to use internal endpoints where possible.
  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  cpu-mode:

      Tell Nova which libvirt image backend to use. Supported backends are raw,
      qcow2, rbd and flat. If no backend is specified, the Nova default (qcow2) is
      used.
      NOTE: 'rbd' imagebackend is only supported with >= Juno.
      NOTE: 'flat' imagebackend is only supported with >= Newton and replaces 'raw'.
  force-raw-images:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: |
      Force conversion of backing images to raw format. Note that the conversion
      process in Pike uses O_DIRECT calls - certain file systems do not support this,
      for example ZFS; e.g. if using the LXD provider with ZFS backend, this option
      should be set to False.
  rbd-pool:
    type: string
    default: nova
    description: |
      RBD pool to use with Nova libvirt RBDImageBackend. Only required when you
      have libvirt-image-backend set to 'rbd'.
  rbd-client-cache:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Enable/disable RBD client cache. Leaving this value unset will result in
      default Ceph RBD client settings being used (RBD cache is enabled by
      default for Ceph >= Giant). Supported values here are 'enabled' or
      'disabled'.
  ceph-osd-replication-count:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      This value dictates the number of replicas Ceph must make of any
      object it stores within the Nova RBD pool. Of course, this only
      applies if using Ceph as a backend store. Note that once the Nova
      RBD pool has been created, changing this value will not have any
      effect (although it can be changed in Ceph by manually configuring
      your Ceph cluster).
  ceph-pool-weight:
    type: int
    default: 30
    description: |
      Defines a relative weighting of the pool as a percentage of the total
      amount of data in the Ceph cluster. This effectively weights the number
      of placement groups for the pool created to be appropriately portioned
      to the amount of data expected. For example, if the ephemeral volumes
      for the OpenStack compute instances are expected to take up 20% of the
      overall configuration then this value would be specified as 20. Note -
      it is important to choose an appropriate value for the pool weight as
      this directly affects the number of placement groups which will be
      created for the pool. The number of placement groups for a pool can
      only be increased, never decreased - so it is important to identify the
      percent of data that will likely reside in the pool.
  restrict-ceph-pools:

    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Name of the metadata pool to be created (for RBD use-cases). If not

      For instance, for k=4 and m=2, when l=3 two groups of three are created.
      Each set can be recovered without reading chunks from another set. Note
      that using the lrc plugin does incur more raw storage usage than isa or
      jerasure in order to reduce the cost of recovery operations.
  ec-profile-crush-locality:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      (lrc plugin) The type of the CRUSH bucket in which each set of chunks
      defined by l will be stored. For instance, if it is set to rack, each
      group of l chunks will be placed in a different rack. It is used to
      create a CRUSH rule step such as step choose rack. If it is not set,
      no such grouping is done.
  ec-profile-durability-estimator:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      (shec plugin - c) The number of parity chunks each of which includes
      each data chunk in its calculation range. The number is used as a

    description: |
      The percentage of system memory to use for hugepages e.g. '10%' or the
      total number of 2M hugepages - e.g. '1024'.
      For a systemd system (wily and later) the preferred approach is to enable
      hugepages via kernel parameters set in MAAS and systemd will mount them
      automatically.
      .
      NOTE: For hugepages to work it must be enabled on the machine deployed
      to. This can be accomplished by setting kernel parameters on capable
      machines in MAAS, tagging them and using these tags as constraints in the
      model.

      Set to 1 to enable KSM, 0 to disable KSM, and AUTO to use default
      settings.
      .
      Please note that the AUTO value works for qemu 2.2+ (> Kilo), older
      releases will be set to 1 as default.
  aa-profile-mode:
    type: string
    default: disable
    description: |
      Control experimental apparmor profile for Nova daemons
      (nova-compute, nova-api and nova-network).  This is separate to
      the apparmor profiles for KVM VMs which is controlled by libvirt
      and is on, in enforcing mode, by default.
      Valid settings: 'complain', 'enforce' or 'disable'.
      .
      Apparmor is disabled by default for the Nova daemons.
  default-availability-zone:
    type: string
    default: nova
    description: |
      Default compute node availability zone.
      .
      This option determines the availability zone to be used when it is not
      specified in the VM creation request. If this option is not set, the
      default availability zone 'nova' is used. If customize-failure-domain
      is set to True, it will override this option only if an AZ is set by
      the Juju provider. If JUJU_AVAILABILITY_ZONE is not set, the value
      specified by this option will be used regardless of
      customize-failure-domain's setting.
      .
      NOTE: Availability zones must be created manually using the
      'openstack aggregate create' command.
      .
  customize-failure-domain:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Juju propagates availability zone information to charms from the
      underlying machine provider such as MAAS and this option allows the
      charm to use JUJU_AVAILABILITY_ZONE to set default_availability_zone for
      Nova nodes. This option overrides the default-availability-zone charm
      config setting only when the Juju provider sets JUJU_AVAILABILITY_ZONE.
  resume-guests-state-on-host-boot:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      This option determines whether to start guests that were running
      before the host rebooted.
  # Monitoring options
  nagios_context:
    type: string
    default: juju
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm. A string that will be
      prepended to instance name to set the host name in nagios. So for
      instance the hostname would be something like:
      .
        juju-myservice-0
      .
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      A comma-separated list of nagios servicegroups. If left empty, the
      nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup.
  use-multipath:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Use a multipath connection for iSCSI or FC volumes. Enabling this feature
      causes libvirt to login, discover and scan available targets before
      presenting the disk via device mapper (/dev/mapper/XX) to the VM instead
      of a single path (/dev/disk/by-path/XX). If changed after deployment,
      each VM will require a full stop/start for changes to take affect.
  ephemeral-device:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Block devices to use for storage of ephemeral disks to support nova
      instances; generally used in-conjunction with 'encrypt' to support
      data-at-rest encryption of instance direct attached storage volumes.
  default-ephemeral-format:
    type: string
    default: ext4
    description: |
      The default format an ephemeral volume will be formatted with on creation.
      Possible values: ext2 ext3 ext4 xfs ntfs (only for Windows guests)
  encrypt:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Encrypt block devices used for Nova instances using dm-crypt, making use
      of vault for encryption key management; requires a relation to vault.
  ephemeral-unmount:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Cloud instances provide ephemeral storage which is normally mounted
      on /mnt.
      .
      Setting this option to the path of the ephemeral mountpoint will force
      an unmount of the corresponding device so that it can be used for as the
      backing store for local instances.  This is useful for testing purposes
      (cloud deployment is not a typical use case).
  notification-format:
    type: string
    default: unversioned
    description: |
      There are two types of notifications in Nova: legacy notifications
      which have an unversioned payload and newer notifications which have
      a versioned payload.
      .
      Setting this option to `versioned` will use the versioned
      notification concept, `unversioned`, the unversioned notification concept
      and finally `both` will use the two concepts.
      .
      Starting in the Pike release, the notification_format includes both the
      versioned and unversioned message notifications. Ceilometer does not yet
      consume the versioned message notifications, so intentionally make the
      default notification format unversioned until this is implemented.
      .
      Possible Values are both, versioned, unversioned.
  send-notifications-to-logs:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Ensure notifications are included in the log files. It will set an additional
      log driver for Oslo messaging notifications.
  libvirt-migration-network:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Specify a network in CIDR notation (192.168.0.0/24),
      which directs libvirt to use a specific network
      address as the live_migration_inbound_addr to make
      use of a dedicated migration network if possible.
      .
      Please note that if the migration binding has been
      declared and set, the primary address for that space has precedence
      over this configuration option.
      .
      This option doesn't have any effect on clouds running
      a release < Ocata.
  bluestore-compression-algorithm:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |

      compressible.
      'aggressive' means use compression unless clients hint that
      data is not compressible.
      'force' means use compression under all circumstances even if the clients
      hint that the data is not compressible.
  bluestore-compression-required-ratio:
    type: float
    default:
    description: |
