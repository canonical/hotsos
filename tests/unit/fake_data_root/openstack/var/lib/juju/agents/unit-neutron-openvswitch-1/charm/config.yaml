      Space-delimited list of bridge:port mappings. Specified ports will be
      added to their corresponding specified bridge. The bridges will allow
      usage of flat or VLAN network types with Neutron and should match this
      defined in bridge-mappings.
      .
      Ports can be specified through the name or MAC address of the interface
      to be added to the bridge. If MAC addresses are used, you may provide
      multiple bridge:mac for the same bridge so as to be able to configure
      multiple units. In this case the charm will run through the provided MAC
      addresses for each bridge until it finds one it can resolve to an
      interface name.
      Port can also be a linuxbridge bridge. In this case a veth pair will be
      created, the ovs bridge and the linuxbridge bridge will be connected. It
      can be useful to connect the ovs bridge to juju bridge.
      .
      Any changes (subsequent to the initial setting) made to the value of this
      option will merely add the new values along with the existing ones. If
      removal of old values is desired, they have to be done manually through
      the command "ovs-vsctl" in the affected units. If the new values conflict
      with the previous ones, it may cause a network outage as seen in bug

          * mode - the bond mode of operation. Possible values are:
            - active-backup - No load balancing is offered in this mode and only one of
                              the member ports is active/used at a time.
            - balance-slb - Considered as a static load-balancing mode. Traffic is load
                            balanced between member ports based on the source MAC and VLAN.
            - balance-tcp - This is the preferred bonding mode. It offers traffic load
                            balancing based on 5-tuple header fields. LACP must be enabled
                            at both endpoints to use this mode. The aggregate link will
                            fall back to default mode (active-passive) in the event of LACP
                            negotiation failure.

      NOTE: This configuration option will be ignored on Trusty and older.
      .
      NOTE: Changing this value will have no effect on runtime configuration. A
      manual restart of the `sriov-netplan-shim` service or reboot of the

      Number of VF's to configure each PF with; by default, each SR-IOV PF will
      be configured with the maximum number of VF's it can support. In the case
      sriov-device-mappings is set, only the devices in the mapping are configured.
      Either use a single integer to apply the same VF configuration to all
      detected SR-IOV devices or use a per-device configuration in the following
      format

      Multiple devices can be configured by providing multi values delimited by

      Enabling this option will make use of the sriov-numvfs option to configure
      the VF functions of the physical network adapters detected in each unit.
      .
      Enabling this option also requires that the firewall-driver option be

  security-group-log-output-base:

    default:
    description: |
      This option allows setting a path for Network Security Group logs.
      A valid file system path must be provided. If this option is not

      Log entries are queued for writing to a log file when a packet rate

  use-dvr-snat:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      This option controls a mode of the l3 agent when DVR is used. There are
      2 modes 'dvr' (default) and dvr_snat (gateway mode). Neutron server
      (deployed by neutron-api charm) will schedule a network:router_centralized_snat port
      and a (centralized) snat namespace to dvr_snat mode agents only. If this option
      is enabled, all neutron-openvswitch nodes become candidates for being centralized
      snat nodes. If l3ha is enabled on neutron-api, relevant packages are also installed
      on every unit making them capable of hosting parts of an L3HA router. The min and max
      numbers of L3 agents per router need to be taken into account in this case
      (see max_l3_agents_per_router and min_l3_agents_per_router Neutron options).
      Practically, this option can be used to allow DVR routers (L3HA or not) to
      be scheduled without a requirement for a dedicated network node to host
      centralized SNAT. This is especially important if only floating IPs are
      used in the network design and SNAT traffic is minimal or non-existent.

      NOTE: This configuration option will be ignored when deployed in a LXD
      container.

  ovs-use-veth:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      "True" or "False" string value. It is safe to leave this option unset.
      This option allows the DHCP agent to use a veth interface for OVS in
      order to support kernels with limited namespace support. i.e. Trusty.
      Changing the value after neutron DHCP agents are created will break
      access. The charm will go into a blocked state if this is attempted.
  keepalived-healthcheck-interval:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Specifies the frequency (in seconds) at which HA routers will check
      their external network gateway by performing an ICMP ping between the
      virtual routers. When the ping check fails, this will trigger the HA
      routers to failover to another node. A value of 0 will disable this
      check. This setting only applies when using l3ha and dvr_snat.
      .
      WARNING: Enabling the health checks should be done with caution as it
      may lead to rapid failovers of HA routers. ICMP pings are low priority
      and may be dropped or take longer than the 1 second afforded by neutron,
      which leads to routers failing over to other nodes.
  of-inactivity-probe:
    type: int
    default: 10
    description: |
      The inactivity_probe interval in seconds for the local switch connection
      to the controller. A value of 0 disables inactivity probes. Used only
      for 'native' driver. The default value is 10 seconds.
  disable-mlockall:
    type: boolean
    default:
    description: |
      Disable Open vSwitch use of mlockall().
      .
      When mlockall() is enabled, all of ovs-vswitchd's process memory is
      locked into physical RAM and prevented from paging. This avoids network
      interruptions but can lead to memory exhaustion in memory-constrained
      environments.
      .
      By default, the charm will disable mlockall() if it is running in a
      container. Otherwise, the charm will default to mlockall() enabled if
      it is not running in a container.
      .
      Changing this config option will restart openvswitch-switch, resulting
      in an expected data plane outage while the service restarts.
